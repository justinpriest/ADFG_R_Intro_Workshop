# ADF&G Workshop: Introduction to R for Fishery Researchers
_Short introductory course for learning the basics of R, tailored for ADF&G fishery biologists._  


## Course Approach
This course does not assume that you have any prior R knowledge, so don't be intimidated!  

Attendees will watch the instructor present the PowerPoint presentation. At the end of each section, students will either work through the scripts that were associated with that section or in a "learnr" tutorial. In the `code` folder there are several groups of scripts. In general, these belong to one of three groups.  
**Tutorials:** There are several "learnr" tutorials, each contained in their own folder.  
**Scripts:** A stand-alone script that demonstrates PowerPoint concepts, and will either be reviewed together or independently.  
**Motivating Examples:** Completed scripts showcasing several types of analyses, charts, and data types.  

To open the code, ALWAYS start by double clicking the `R_Intro_AFS.Rproj` file. Next, open the files as normal. This will ensure that the files run properly. Don't worry if this sounds a little confusing, we'll cover all this in class!  

Code is numbered to be associated with each section in the PowerPoint, i.e., concepts covered in PowerPoint Section 2 "Basic Programming" correspond to code reviewed in `Tutorial_2_Basics` and in the script `2_Basic_Programming.R`  

To run the learnr tutorials on your own computer you will need to paste the following code into R and then run it:  
`install.packages(c("learnr", "shiny", "tidyverse", "lubridate", "scales", "palmerpenguins", "patchwork"))`  
Then open the desired tutorial script in RStudio and click "Run Document" above the script pane. 

## Your Instructors
Welcome to the course! Your instructors are Justin Priest and Matt Tyers, 
a biologist and biometrician for ADF&G. We have both learned R through a variety 
of methods including self-taught instruction, formal courses, reading books, and 
just by playing around in the program. We designed this course specifically based 
on many of the difficulties we both encountered on our journey. Justin and Matt 
both have experience teaching R to others and have taken a workshop on how to 
improve our teaching styles. That said, please ask us questions at any time!  


## Agenda
This course will be split over two days of about 8 hours each day.
Before each section we will take a small break.

## Course Outcomes
- Recognize basic codes / commands
- Know the how & why of what code does  
- Use this knowledge in new situations to create a visualization  
- Recall resources to use after the class   

## Expected Behavior
Be kind: all else is details. _Remember, this includes being kind to YOU_  
We are teaching & learning this together. _Teach each other_  
Every mistake is a lesson. _Ask us or yourself why something didn’t work_  
Communicate when we're going too fast. _Let’s keep this a dialog_
